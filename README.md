# Alaska Snowpack Model

This model was developed in Python by Sam Neitlich and based off of previously implemented models. A more detailed description can be found in the attached Python notebook and R script. The photos folder shows some model outputs and example maps that were created in R and Python. These are all outputs of the code, and can be reproduced simply by running the two scripts.

To run this Python script, simply upload into Google Colab. It can also be run in Jupyter Notebooks with minimal editing.
